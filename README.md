#### - Engine Volume: Sport cars have larger engines than economy 
#### - Year: The older the car, the cheaper it is

## The rest of columns are catigorical variables which we will deal with on a case-by-case basis



# Steps for creating the Regression Model 
### - Clean the dataset (Preprocessing)
### - Relax Assumptions 
### - Log Transformation 
### - Create a Dummies
### - Create a Model
